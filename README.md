# Hierarchical-Analysis-of-Mouse-Neocortex-Single-Cell-RNA-seq-Data

Embark on a journey through the intricacies of a single-cell RNA-seq dataset sourced from the Allen Institute, meticulously curated to unravel the enigmatic hierarchical structures within the mouse neocortex. This vital brain region orchestrates higher-level cognitive functions, making it a fascinating terrain to explore.

The goal was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of various subsets of this expansive dataset. By delving into the genetic intricacies at the single-cell level, I aimed to unearth hidden patterns and spotlight pivotal genes that govern cellular distinctions. Through this exploration, I aspired to identify informative features capable of discerning diverse cell types within the mouse neocortex.
